    "passage":"Be given a reprieve by the winter, and therefore the war will carry on for far longer. So, and despite all the sympathy Ukraine deserves and despite the courage shown by its armed forces, there must be cool calculations of the costs. Difficult as it is to swallow, Ukraine needs to be realistic. It must realize that Putin may prefer blowing up everything rather than surrender. That he does need something so he can spin away a retreat. Plus, the war has taken a massive toll on the Ukrainian economy. It can really afford any more damage. India, which has reached out to both Moscow and Kyiv and walked a difficult diplomatic tightrope, can help with peace talks. In fact, PM Mode yesterday spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and called for cessation of hostilities and the need to pursue dialogue. This is sensible. And Putin knows even his main strategic partner China is happy with his Ukraine operations. This gives some leverage to bring him to the table. Some European countries want the conflict to end, and not wait for a victory over Putin. They should try and persuade Ukraine. Peace looks elusive but is impossible. There are three things India needs from the West at this juncture. One, massive, urgent carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere, creating net negative emissions to avert climate disaster that ravages the world equally but creates more distress in those parts that lack the financial resources to cushion the impact. Two, an early, negotiated end to the war in Ukraine. Three, liberal immigration into the US to bring down inflation in that country and ease distress in the rest of the world. Can a cheetah change its spots? That the question surrounding Operation Cheetah, a project by which eight of the felines, the fastest land animals in the world, have been relocated from their native habitat in Namibia to the Keno National Park, Madhya Pradesh, bringing back to the country a species which has been extinct for the past 75 years, the last three survivors having been shot by a maharajah in 1947. During the reign of Akbar there were reportedly over 10,000 of these animals in India. But unrestricted hunting and their displacement by a growing human population spelt their doom. Will this tragic tale be repeated? The project to resurrect the cheetah, Phoenix-like from the ashes of history, aims at bringing in over five years 50 of the magnificent beasts to inhabit various national parks across the country. Conservationists have expressed fears that the animals might not be able to adapt to their unfamiliar environment. Moreover, even as PM Mode has expressly enjoined the residents of the villages abutting the Keno National Park to become cheetah-rashes and protect the animals from the disruptive intrusion of sightseers even if they happen to be VVIPs like himself people associated with the tourism industry are already touting the rare felines as a money-spinning attraction for visitors. The central issue is whether the cheetah or."
