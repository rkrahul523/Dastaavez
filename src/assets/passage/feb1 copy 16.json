    "passage":"Performance in Punjab, he will need a massive political skills upgrade to take on BJP and replace Congress as the main challenger in the heartland, which is where he must succeed if he to challenge Modi in 2024. AAP caste playbook is very thin, and the question is whether it has enough time to change that for national polls. If AAP can upgrade fast enough and Congress continues to wither away, the opposition has a big problem: Who will effectively fight BJP in seat heavy north India Congress is also a lesson for other family led parties, as is SP. If you are bound hand and foot to a family and if that family does deliver, and if you have no culture of encouraging new talent, how do you imagine a new future Today BJP is so formidable only because in 2014, it made Modi its national face, in the teeth of opposition from many then prominent national leaders. As for the future of India economy and its ability to spread mass prosperity, these elections will be pivotal in one of two ways. Either party will think that welfares and rank populism will win polls and therefore reforms are unnecessary and probably politically costly. Or, hopefully, at least some of them will conclude that the fiscal limits of welfares will be reached very soon and that growth and jobs via smart policies is the only sustainable political economic formula in a country where a vast number of low income citizens are looking for reasonably well paid jobs. It is vital that BJP, the most influential party by far, chooses the correct alternative. There is a popular saying that success comes through lanes and backyards, not from the front door. That explains BJP remarkable success in UP. During the election campaign, we observed two trends. One, many people, after complaining shipway shikayat against BJP, concluded by saying: Vote toh Modi ji aur kamal ko hi denge Despite our complaints, we will vote for Modi ji and lotus. The political history of UP has turned a new corner. The BJP government is the first incumbent to be returned to power since 1989, and it has done so with a handsome near two thirds majority. In a bipolar election, it was always going to be a daunting task for SP to compete with BJP, a party which had commanded almost twice the vote share of SP in the last election. To win, SP needed to fulfill two conditions: It needed to consolidate the scattered opposition vote in its camp and it needed to shave off a section of the BJP vote. SP only partially fulfilled the first condition, while failing miserably in the second. The Covid 19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that happiness is so essential to our ability to thrive as humans. Happiness is the building block of our being and for businesses that want to win the future. As science shows, when we re stressed, burnt out and depleted."
