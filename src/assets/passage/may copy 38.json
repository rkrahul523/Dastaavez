    "passage":"That why it will willy-nilly join any war against India. China does hate India. It just wants to contain India rise, just like it had wanted to do in 1962. A war between Pakistan and India will accomplish that. The author Gurcharan Das has said that an MBA culture has pervaded India, that everyone wants to get into business. This Banyan culture stops India from being a martial force. It is inward looking and prevents India from taking advantage of external strategic opportunities. Pakistan has caused such mayhem in India: making the entire Indian Kashmir go aflame, the Parliament attack, 26 11, Pulwama. Yet we reacted only to Pulwama. Even then it was a triangular affair Pulwama, Balakot, Rajouri without much achieved. Pakistan caused Pulwama, we responded with Balakot, the Pakistanis responded with Rajouri. What will attacking Pakistan achieve for India now? Pakistan two provinces, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are in ferment. It will not take much to cause them to split away from Pakistan. Sindh detests Pakistani Punjab dominance and would like to separate as well. What will remain of Pakistan would be a neutered Punjabistan. What will happen to Pakistan nukes? America would be more than glad to pay off Pakistan for its nukes. The opportunity for India is now. The opportunity to live in peace and constantly not be blackmailed by a bellicose enemy. Will India grab it? Education material including documents, posters, and videos, onboarding forms and processes, all digital transaction portals along with their terms & conditions must be made available in all Indian languages. This must be made mandatory by the government for all financial institutions in the country. The good news is, advancements in technology have made it quick, easy, and cost-effective to add languages to both digital and offline content. Today, Indian companies are creating world-class machine translations, localization platforms, local language catboats, voice bots, and much more. We do not need to rely on foreign giants for these services. The development of India digital economy depends on the use of regional languages. They can aid in increasing literacy rates and bridging the communication gap between customers and service providers. India needs to encourage the use of regional languages if it is to reach its goal of a $1 trillion digital economy by FY 26. A unique window of opportunity lies ahead of us that holds the power to change our growth trajectory. The integration of local language support in the Digital India movement has the potential to redefine its success and create a case study for the world to follow. Society Indira Gandhi was a prescient ruler. In 1971, she recognized that the troubles in East Pakistan presented her with a golden opportunity to hive Pakistan into two. She dressed Indian soldiers in Mufti Tahini clothes, taking a lesson from 1948, when Pakistan dressed its own soldiers in clothes of Muslim raiders, and sent her forces into East Pakistan, creating Bangladesh. Voila, a two-winged Pakistan ceased to exist. Bangladesh lives without."
