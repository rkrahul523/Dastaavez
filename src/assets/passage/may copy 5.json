    "passage":"Their minority vote banks. It may be pertinent to note that these politicians did not speak up for the common man who suffered at the hands of criminals like Atiq Ahmed for nearly forty years. Even the governments of the day just looked the other way and let the don have his way. Are there any concerns for the common man on the street because of these two incidents? Frankly, for the majority there will be none and this will include people from all faiths. For those unlucky ones who were directly part of the gangsters fear empire, it would be time to breathe easy. Those who were part of the team in running such an empire, would lie low till things cool down and then take a call on what to do next. Some will continue to harp on the communal angle for selfish reasons and in doing so, they will be compelled to overlook the don criminal record and the sufferings caused to thousands of families over the years. The two incidents do, however, raise some questions. The current state government has its task cut out. It has to conduct fair probes in both the incidents. If there is any complicity or inefficiency of the police or any other state authority in the killings, then the government has to come down with a heavy hand on those involved. The protection of criminals when taken outside the jail, needs to be reviewed to make it more potent. While the police encounter incident will be a limited internal probe, the killing of Mr Atiq Ahmed and his brother at the hospital entry will be different. The authorities will have to unearth the motives and those behind the killings by widening the probe. Old enmities or fear of being exposed appear to be the obvious motives. Sincere and honest investigations, in a reasonable time frame, will go a long way in boosting the confidence of the people in the state government and its agencies, rantings of the opposition notwithstanding. Finally, the common man would be hoping that similar larger-than-life gangsters do not surface again in the future. India has been grappling with rising fuel costs, which have become a major concern for the country economy. In this context, the transition to green fuel and Compressed Biogas CBG offers a sustainable solution to India fuel needs. The government recent initiatives to promote the usage of green fuel and CBG are a step in the right direction. Green fuel is a renewable source of energy that can be produced from waste. It is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and helps reduce carbon emissions. The production of green fuel involves the use of biodegradable waste such as agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and sewage. The waste is processed and converted into biofuel through a series of biochemical reactions. The resulting biofuel can be used as a substitute for diesel or petrol. CBG, on the other hand, is produced by compressing biogas to high pressure. Biogas is produced by the breakdown of organic waste such as cow dung, agricultural waste, and sewage. The compressed biogas can be used as a substitute for natural gas. The benefits of using green fuel and CBG are manifold. They help reduce India dependence on fossil fuels and promote a cleaner environment. The use of waste as a raw material promotes waste management and reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The production of green fuel and CBG also creates new job opportunities and boosts the local economy. The government has taken several initiatives to promote the usage of green fuel and CBG. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has launched the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation SATAT initiative. Under this initiative, the government aims to set up 5,000 CBG plants across."
