    "passage":"For each district as a reference point that these resources were once intact. The PLPCs could assume this responsibility by design. To achieve responsive governance of common resources, the effectiveness of a top down rule of law approach, which puts encroachments at the centre stage, needs to be evaluated. Land is a political issue, and thriving common lands characterise social capital, social cohesion, and social harmony. PLPCs can thus focus on more effective interventions to support Panchayati and village institutions in managing these resources. Working to improve social relations, while having conflict resolution as an auxiliary arm, may deliver more just outcomes. With almost two years of empty classrooms, silent playgrounds and deserted corridors, schools are set to welcome students back to the campus. This is a good time to reflect on how we can make this transition as smooth as possible for our students. All children might have had different experiences during the lockdown, and they may react quite differently to the reopening of physical schools. Some will readily return to school, while others will struggle and experience anxiety or apprehension about moving out of the comfort of their homes. Teachers must be prepared to deal with this and devise a transition plan that benefits everyone and allows for a smooth return to school. It might make sense to reopen in a phased manner. Fewer school hours for the first few days might be the best way to go as it will help students make the gradual transition from online school to physical school. Some basic guidelines that can help educational institutes and teachers to make this smoother for children, include: Focus on safety protocols: As schools reopen, everyone emphasis will be on safety protocols, especially because children are not vaccinated. Parents may be wary and have reservations about sending their child to school. Try to put the parents mind at ease by informing them of all safety guidelines that are in place in the school. Creating a virtual tour so that new parents can see the infrastructure and classrooms and understand what it would be like for their child to attend school will definitely be very useful. Additionally, schools can organise virtual parent orientations to debrief parents about everything they need to know and prepare for before school starts Need for structures and routines: An important thing for teachers to focus on would be how can he she create a classroom environment that welcomes children back to school after the long hiatus Creating a daily schedule will help children know what to expect. This schedule can be shared before the school reopens to give students time to understand it and come well prepared on the first day of school. Having a physical copy put up in the classroom might also prove beneficial. Setting up classroom routines will be extremely important as students have not seen a normal school day for a long time. The online routines and structures were significantly different so teachers will need to spend time."
