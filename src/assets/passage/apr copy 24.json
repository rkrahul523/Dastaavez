Suppose you are at the airport, and your flight is delayed an insurance company, provides flight delay insurance utilizing smart contracts. So, how do they compensate you in case there is a flight delay The smart contract is linked to the database recording flight status. The smart contract is created based on terms and conditions. The condition set for the insurance policy is a delay of two hours or more. Based on the code, the smart contract holds money until that certain condition is met. The smart contract is submitted to the nodes on a runtime compiler to execute the smart contract code for evaluation. All the nodes on the network executing the code must come to the same result. That result is recorded on the distributed ledger. If the flight is delayed more than two hours, the smart contract self executes, and you are compensated. Smart contracts are immutable; no one may alter the agreement. Using it makes the transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible. In conclusion the fear of exclusion is the biggest.
