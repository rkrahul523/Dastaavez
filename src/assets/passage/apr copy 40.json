    "passage":"Data, and automatically regulates data enter temperatures, all while reducing energy usage. AI improves storage accurate and dependability with smart security features that identify data packet loss during transit or within data centers, which in turn reduces data loss, improves availability, and speeds up turnaround time especially during downtime. Another developing benefit of AI enabled storage is neural storage. Despite the absence of human assistance, neural class storage can easily perceive and respond to storage issues and opportunities. Future of Data Storage with AI Going forward, when AI demands to increase the size of storage systems, the capacity of human engineers to manage, monitor, and maintain this large scale data storage becomes compromised. This bottleneck in scalability and efficiency is resolved with AI enabled data storage. While modern storage systems and applications can gather large data volumes and create actionable information, it is difficult to move forward without the intelligence and automation of AI powered storage systems the ones that can self predict and analyze data in real time. The union budget for 2022 was announced amid much fanfare. We waited to hear about funds allocated to the healthcare sector with bated breath. While some promising features were added to aid public health tele mental health centres, digitising the health ecosystem, uplifting districts lagging in the health care system, the entire healthcare system had mixed feelings towards this budget. While digitising the system is a welcome change, considering digital therapeutics and allocating funds or drafting policies to help the public benefit from it could have been an enormous step forward in improving public health. However, this might be a far fetched dream for the big names in the Detox domain because there are still many pain points that need to be addressed at the moment and one of them remains the eternal debate on insurance coverage and diabetes in a country which is the Diabetes capital of the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the estimated number of diabetes patients in the 20 79 age group is 74.2 million in 2021 and is likely to increase to 124.8 million in 2045. A campaign in August 2021 showed some startling data For people over 40, with BMI above 23 and a family history of type 2 diabetes, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases by 40 times. Furthermore, with over 90 million people with prediabetes, 70% will convert to type 2 diabetes in the next 5 10 years. Going by these numbers, it is evident that the burden of diabetes brings along with it the economic burden of its treatment and care. A decade back, buying insurance for people living with diabetes was difficult because of the risk involved. Nevertheless, government policies and diabetes specific insurance have been rolled out, seeing the growing numbers. There are many plans that one can choose from. However, one might still find it challenging to find an insurance policy that covers all costs medicine, hospitalisation, and complications due to comorbidities to relieve financial."
