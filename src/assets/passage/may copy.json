    "passage":"Even if sadly small as a proportion of its population, its entrepreneurial energy, its potential as a manufacturing hub given its young workforce, and a political and policy culture that grown more receptive to needs of business. But the sluggishness of its legal system and its tendency to often change commercial and tax rules are reputational minuses, because they affect the critical matter of contractual consistency. Add to this the degree of social disharmony, both real and as perceived by investors. A harmonious society is always bound to be more attractive in a highly competitive global business environment. In India, Karnataka is increasingly posing a question on this issue. The state is a magnet for all job seekers because of the economic vibrancy catalysed by the technology sector. Being an open and tolerant society has helped greatly. But now the state that was a beacon of hope for all of India seems to be narrowing options for a section of its own residents. On every level that is wrong and harms India. And since reputations matter, and optics are indeed consequential, political calls that translate into undermining livelihood opportunities of Muslims are damaging for the business environment if not now, then over the medium term. Some argue that Gujarat emergence as a business hub has been affected despite the 2002 riots. The point is that there have been no major riots in Gujarat since then, and that contributed to its investment attractiveness. Neither countries nor individual firms are any longer immune to pressure that comes from a deteriorating reputation. The scope of such pushback is not fixed, it evolves over time as collective standards change. Even China, with its gigantic 15 trillion economy, could prevent exits out of Hong Kong after its crackdown on democracy activists. Karnataka politicians need to keep these lessons in mind. Creating opportunities for everyone is not only intrinsically good, it also sets a virtuous cycle in motion. The word assessment figures 65 times in the National Education Policy, 2020, while the word examination figures only 11 times with respect to school education. That in itself is saying a great deal. It is crucial that our school ecosystem comprehends the subtle difference between the two. Buying some instant coffee for me online, Bunny came across an economic anomaly. If she bought one packet of the product it would cost x rupees. If she bought 2 packets, the cost would be not 2x rupees but 2x plus rupees. Which meant that if one bought two packets separately they would be cheaper than if they were bought together as a combo, or combination, deal. Such a proposition goes against both mathematical and marketing logic. Because of what called economies of scale, bulk purchases of any product cost less, item for item, than single purchases. If a single tube of toothpaste retails for Rest 100, if you were to buy 100 tubes of the same toothpaste you had expect to get each tube at the wholesale rate of Rest."
