Only when the shareholders and investors are assured of complete transparency of the compliance processes can the businesses invoke confidence in them. In addition, compliance systems have to be put in place that can flag non-compliance and its associated risk so that the concerned officer can intervene in a timely manner. At the outset, businesses must shift towards smart and automated compliance solutions that enhance their control and visibility over compliance functions. Smart and automated compliance management can enable businesses to stay alert, aware, and ahead of the curve at all times while providing effective safeguards against lapses, delays and defaults. With a variety of unique features such as customised checklists, integrated database, real-time regulatory updates, automated alerts and reminders, an in-built document management system and periodic analytics, digital compliance software have become an indispensable tool for any business today.

The quest for accurate, timely and transparent compliance may be arduous but if equipped with the right tools, it can become seamless. Rethinking compliance management through the lens of digitisation, sensitisation and innovation should, hence, assume top priority for businesses across the nation.
