This term concerns using and creating technology on behalf of society. More than a tool to improve production, technology should contribute to people well-being. The future of education will redefine the best practices in Management Education 5.0 where the special lab classes can be introduced to improve the weak area of students. The onus of transforming conventional students into active learners rests on the teachers. In this strictly outcome-based education, the role of the teacher is required to be that of a guiding force or a mentor rather than that of just imparting knowledge. The lack of face-to-face contact with the class requires unique behavioral and instructional skills and competencies in the teacher and this master class is about what these skills are and how to develop them. Management Education 5.0 will be the future in our educational systems. The stubbornness of high inflation could force the Reserve Bank of India RBI to hike the repo rate again in April. To be sure, inflation based on the Consumer Price Index CPI moderated to 6.44 in February, from 6.52 in January, thanks to easing fuel prices. But it failed to bring relief because the stickier components of inflation food and core remain high, and CPI inflation is still outside the RBI target band of 2-6. In fact, it stayed above 6 in 10 of the past 12 months. What worries is the rising build-up of risks, especially on the food price front. If the risks materialise, food prices could feel the heat for the second year in a row, hitting household budgets. Broadly, throughout this fiscal, the trajectory of headline CPI inflation has mirrored the movement in food prices. The next few months will not be any different. Food prices will continue to guide headline inflation. As food inflation softens in the base case of normal monsoon in 2023, headline inflation, too, should moderate. In the base case, headline CPI inflation is seen coming down to 5 in fiscal 2024, from an estimated 6.8 in fiscal 2023. Despite the softening, inflation rates for most sub-components will be higher than the pre-pandemic five-year average, which suggests a lower-than-desired extent of moderation in inflation. Food inflation is expected to moderate, assuming a normal monsoon. However, some headwinds could limit the extent of moderation or, worse, flare inflation further. In the worst case, where food inflation remains as high as in fiscal 2023, the headline inflation forecast gets pushed up 80-90 basis points, inching closer to the uncomfortable 6 mark. Crosscurrents in food inflation Food inflation is typically influenced by three factors: climate patterns monsoon and weather disruption, minimum support price MSP movements, and global food prices. This year, there is limited relief on these fronts amid a build-up of risks of late. But one more factor that matters, is certain to provide some respite the high base-effect from fiscal 2023. The food index climbed almost 6.8 on-year in fiscal 2023, with prices of cereals mainly wheat up over 10 and milk over 7. Inflation in meat and fish, edible oils, pulses, and vegetables has either moderated or seen a modest rise. A high base effect should statistically lower food inflation in items that saw prices jump. But the weather risks to inflation are climbing higher. After four consecutive normal monsoons, chances of another one in 2023 are low. Since 1901, there have been only seven instances when the southwest monsoon has been normal above normal for four or more years in a row. Moreover, there are fears of an disrupting."
