    "passage":"AI enabled storage? Let dig deeper. Exploring the Advantages of AI enabled Storage Data being the new fuel for AI; it follows the need for legacy data storages to be transformed into smart storage solutions. This requires embedded deep learning and GPU processors which enables them to process real time insights and leverage advantages for AI enabled storage as follows: Scalability: AI algorithms can process huge data volumes in real time, demanding a need for significant storage demands. By provisioning of AI enabled cloud storage, storage can scale up intelligently as per the business requirements. Shared Data vs. Stored Data: In a data driven world, shared data proved to be more valuable than stored data. AI enabled storage makes it happen using advanced analytics and AI processed workloads, which helps scale out storage platforms that resolve downtime issues through data driven insights. Data Insights: AI powered storage uses various analytical tools to deliver fast, reliable insights from billions of stored objects and files. This makes data more useful for major business decisions for organizations. Automation: With help of Software Defined Storage, along with AI and ML, storage ecosystem can now add software layers on top of hardware and tracking more data. This allows managers to focus on strategic initiatives. Also, automation of storage facilities can be powered by AI and with their flexible and adaptable design, it is easy to manage, access, and reroute data center traffic to regulate datacenter temperatures automatically. Reporting and Alerting: AI enabled storage further enables organizations to build reports based on the insights delivered, which then enables alerting system configurations, data storage failure mitigation, and anomaly remediation. One such example of reporting is Power BI by Microsoft. This promotes Learning Data Lifecycles and helps regulate data storage in the best possible way. Failure Prediction: Productivity can be hugely impacted by storage failures. And, if the failure happens, organizations might recover lost data, restore it from a backup, but ultimately it will hinder productivity. With AI enabled storage, there a seamless detection of failures and data recovery happens instantly from the point of failure. Cost effective: AI assisted storage aids in the identification of data utility and usage patterns. This aids in the decisions on data storage, data management, and unwanted data filtration. As a result, enterprises may make informed decisions about data storage capacity and save money on the expenses of holding massive amounts of data. AI enabled Storage vs. Cloud Storage There are multiple ways in which AI enabled storage over performs than a typical cloud storage, to name a few: AI enabled storage enables us to deploy cost effective software defined storage, which efficiently allows data storage and easily recovers data from customers for insight led actions. The automation of operations connected with infrastructure, capacity, and storage management and maintenance is another benefit of AI enabled storage above traditional cloud storage. AI enabled storage provides a more agile and flexible architecture for enterprise storage ecosystem. It intelligently monitors access rights, dynamically reroutes datacenter."
