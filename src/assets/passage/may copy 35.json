    "passage":"Mixtures are constituted by more than one kind of pure form of matter. We know that dissolved sodium chloride can be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself a pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. Based on the composition, mixture can be defined as homogeneous mixture and heterogeneous mixture. A mixture in which its constituents are distributed uniformly is called homogeneous mixture, such as salt in water. A mixture in which its constituents are not distributed uniformly is called heterogeneous mixture, such as sand in water. Based on the particle size of the component, mixtures are further classified into solution, a suspension and a colloid. We will see these in the next exercise. To get more information on these fourth and fifth states of matter. Is Matter around us pure How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter, salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy from the market are pure? Have you ever noticed the word pure written on the packs of these consumables? For a common person pure means having no adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure. For example, milk is actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particles. In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most of the matter around us exist as mixtures of two or more pure components. For example: sea water, minerals, soil etc. are all mixtures. A suspension and a colloid a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent is called the solute. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called a dilute or concentrated solution; a saturated or unsaturated solution. A solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving is said to be a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. The particles of a solution are smaller than 151 nm in diameter. So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. Because of very."
