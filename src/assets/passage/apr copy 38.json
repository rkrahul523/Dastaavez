Thus, the matter ended without going into the larger issue of placing effective mechanism to check any such possibility in future. The biological and chemical weapons had been used in the past and some steps were taken to ensure that they are not used. These are included in the Weapons of Mass Destruction WMD. Two important Conventions are in place to prohibit their development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer and use. While the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention BTWC entered into force on 26 the March 1975 and has 183 States Parties including all P5 countries and Ukraine, the Chemical Weapons Convention CWC, which came into force on 29 the April 1997.

She was also reported to have stated that the US was working with Ukraine to prevent Russia from getting those research materials. In addition, the WHO is reported to have advised Ukraine to immediately destroy high threat pathogens stored at Ukraine bio labs to prevent any potential spills that would have catastrophic consequences. In view of the foregoing, it was imperative on the part of UNCS to take cognizance of the reports and work out a plan to establish a mechanism like we have for the CWC. Unfortunately, there was no attempt in this direction. The issue got lost in the accusations and counter accusations. India did try to focus on the larger issue. India Permanent Representative at the UN T S Tirumurthy highlighting the importance of the BTWC as a key global and non discriminatory disarmament convention, stressed that India believes that any matter relating to obligations under the BTWC should be addressed as per the provisions of the Convention, and through consultations and cooperation between the parties concerned. This approach is based on realism and needs to push up to ensure establishment of a strong multilateral apparatus to verify such matters. If it is not done, Covid 19 type of viruses can keep on visiting this planet with devastating consequences. India social sector is witnessing unprecedented growth as well as disruption. The robust civil society in India continues to work tirelessly towards accomplishing transformational change in socioeconomic structures to bring prosperity for all where the benefits of growth and opportunities are more fairly distributed across communities and regions. Simultaneously, there has been rapid growth of the philanthropic community both in terms of increase in the amount of."
