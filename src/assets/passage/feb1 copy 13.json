    "passage":"Of surveys or questions themselves. This makes it necessary to augment employee listening efforts with the fundamentals of listening openness, transparency, trust, and communication, all of which also characterize the leadership style of introverts. It is not the method that organizations deploy for employee listening efforts that determines the success or failure of their outcomes, but the leaders themselves. Moreover, this is not to say that extroverted leaders are ineffectual at employee listening. Ultimately, listening and empathy are skills that can be nurtured by extroverted leaders too, and these skills can be exercised at every stage of employee listening initiatives. So, before authorizing a survey, understand if you can act on the promises, and consider the impact that inaction would have on employees. Or, like Deborah Dun sire, CEO and President of Millennium, drop in on employees desks, and ask them what keeping them up at night. Taking lessons from the introverted leadership notebook, employee listening efforts can be supercharged in a plethora of ways, for the avenues for listening are more than ample. In today digital world, data is the foundation and currency upon which information is transacted. The vast amount of data that organizations process and store is growing, increasing the need for privacy practices and security. Computing environments have become extremely complex and routinely include numerous data sources from the cloud, corporate data centers, Iota sensors, third party servers and other platforms. This complexity increases the risk of attack and makes it more difficult for businesses to monitor and protect their data. It is crucial for organizations to incorporate data security and privacy policies into a robust data governance strategy to prevent data leakage and achieve regulatory compliance. Many companies believe their data security policies cover data protection and vice versa, but data security and data protection are not synonymous. There is a distinctive difference between data security and data protection. Data protection covers procedures and guidelines that control the collection, storage, disclosure and use of personal data (PII), sensitive personal data (SPI) and company information. This refers to the rules and regulations that ensure that personal information is managed in the same manner as the data subject preferences. According to the Verizon Data Leakage Investigation Report (DBIR), between 2019 and 2021, a total of 79,635 reportable data breach cases occurred worldwide, resulting in losses of up to $4.2 billion. As with last year, financially motivated attacks were the most common, and organized criminals remain number one. Data security is commonly referred to as information confidentiality, availability, and integrity. It all about practices and procedures focused on protecting sensitive or confidential data from unauthorised access, cyber-attacks, and accidental or intentional data loss. Data security also ensures that your data is accurate, reliable, and available to authorised users. Everyone, from individuals to high level businesses and governments, can be exposed to data breaches. More importantly, anyone can endanger others if not protected. In many cases, a small password change cannot protect against a data breach. From global corporations."
