    "passage":"It is common knowledge that several of the world largest corporations have visually pleasing workplaces. These are a complete departure from the traditional cubicle approach. Such workplaces aim to make work enjoyable and free of boredom. Many businesses are beginning to follow suit, with flexible office space providers leading the way. Community halls, caf√©s, and informal gathering areas are now available in shared office buildings, facilitating networking and instilling a feeling of community among employees. Workplace design is also becoming smarter, with more natural light, open areas, and other benefits. In terms of architecture, these places are not only visually appealing but also create inclusive shared areas. Virtual collaboration tools will be much more engaging with the usage of AR VR technology as hybrid work solidifies over the next years. The met averse, which has seen many real world applications yet, will be used to improve teamwork. Furthermore, individuals will be connected remotely thanks to the confluence of new technologies like AI, ML, Iota, and others. The world is slowly moving away from the traditional concept of office. Despite the early days, it is pertinent to note that this movement seems irreversible. As more employees seek better work life balance and organisations tap talent base globally, the future of workspace will heavily tilt in favor of flexible office spaces. However, the future of the workspace is still in its evolution and the final word is yet to be written. Men reproductive health is an important topic that often goes overlooked in discussions about fertility and family planning. While men are not solely responsible, they do play a significant role in the process of conceiving and having children. Therefore, it is important that men understand their own reproductive health and the optimal age for fatherhood. One of the most important things for men to understand about their reproductive health is that fertility naturally declines with age. While it is not uncommon for men to father children well into their 50s and beyond, the odds of conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy do decrease as men get older. For example, a man in his 20s has a much higher fertility rate than a man in his 40s. The decline in male fertility worldwide is a worrying trend that has been noted by researchers and medical professionals in recent years. Several studies have shown that the quality and quantity of sperm in men has been decreasing, leading to a decrease in fertility and reproductive health. One of the main causes of this decline is thought to be the increasing levels of environmental pollution. Exposure to pollutants such as pesticides, chemicals, and heavy metals has been linked to a decrease in sperm production and function. In addition, lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increased stress levels can also contribute to the decline in male fertility. Another factor contributing to the decline in male fertility is the increasing age of fatherhood. As men are waiting longer to have children, their sperm quality and quantity may be reduced due to the natural decline that occurs with age. As men get older, the sperm they produce may be less motile (able to move) and have a lower concentration of healthy sperm. In addition, certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity can also negatively impact male fertility. In addition to declining fertility, older fathers are also more likely to have children with certain health conditions. For example, men over the age of 40 are more likely to have children with chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome. They are also more likely to have children with autism or other developmental."
