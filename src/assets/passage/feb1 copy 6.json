    "passage":"As the world most populous country and the third largest energy consumer, India faces enormous challenges in meeting its energy needs sustainably. However, the country is making remarkable strides toward energy independence through the adoption of clean technology. With its focus on renewable energy sources and commitment to investing in new technologies, India is well on its way to realizing its vision of a sustainable and energy independent future. Pathways to Atmanirbhar Bharat the recently released Economic Survey has outlined a plan to make India energy independent by 2047. The prestigious Berkeley Lab has also released a report that says India can achieve energy independence by 2047 through clean technology. The study titled Pathways to Atmanirbhar Bharat, released by the U.S. Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley Lab came to this conclusion after examining India three most energy intensive sectors power, transport, and industry. Achieving energy independence will generate significant environmental, energy, and economic benefits, which include $2.5 trillion in consumer savings by 2047, enhancing India industrial competitiveness globally, reducing fossil fuel import expenditure by 90, or $240 billion per year by 2047, and enabling India net zero commitment ahead of schedule. Energy Challenges India energy consumption ranks third globally, and as a result of rapid economic growth, its energy demand is projected to quadruple in the coming decades. The country is heavily reliant on imports for its energy needs, with 90 of its oil, 80 of its industrial coal, and 40 of its natural gas being sourced from other countries. The volatility in the global energy market puts a strain on India foreign exchange reserves, resulting in economy wide inflation. Unique Advantage India has a unique advantage to leapfrog to a clean energy future as the bulk of its energy infrastructure has yet to be built. India growing energy demand offers a significant runway of fifteen years for the existing fossil energy assets to transition to clean energy. This transition will be important to do in concert with the most affected communities, ensuring an equitable transition for the country workforce. Clean Energy Deployment India energy infrastructure requires a $3 trillion investment in the coming decades. The existing policy framework can be leveraged to expand clean energy deployment. Prioritizing new energy assets that are cost effective and clean is crucial for long term financial sustainability. Significant policy support is required, including deployment mandates for clean technologies, financial and policy support for emerging technologies such as green hydrogen, and investment in domestic manufacturing capacity. Political Leadership The intent of the political leadership of India seems to be aligned with the clean energy transition, which does not seem like a challenge. India is one of the world largest auto and steel exporters, with their largest markets in EU countries committed to carbon neutrality and a potential carbon border adjustment tariff. Success Seems Assured! The adoption of clean technology and the commitment to renewable energy sources make India well poised to become energy independent by 2047. The Berkeley Lab study shows."
