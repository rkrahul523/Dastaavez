    "passage":"Ever since India gained independence, it has been on a progressive path of development. For the past several decades, India has been one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. However, India development has not been uniform. Some of the cities in the country like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore have seen world class development with modern infrastructure, high living standards, medical facilities, educational institutions, and high per capita income. The situation, however, beyond the major cities has been totally different. Until recently, most tier 2 and tier 3 cities lacked basic infrastructure, facilities, and opportunities. This forced people from these towns to migrate to the bigger cities in search of jobs, education, medical facilities, and better living standards. The situation in the rural areas was even worse. However, things have rapidly been changing in past few years. The efforts of the government and the emergence of digital technologies have led to a rapid transformation of life in these cities.

The Internet has opened the doors to the global standards of education in these cities. Teachers are now equipped with world class knowledge and have access to the latest devices and technology. Students and parents have also embraced technology with open arms. Earlier, any new development in the education sector remained confined to the bigger cities. By the time it reached the smaller towns, cities, and rural areas, it was already outdated. However, the internet has changed it all. Today, the knowledge available to the big cities is also readily available to the smaller towns and cities. The Internet has also removed the barriers of time and place. In the pre internet era, students had to migrate to bigger cities for better and latest education. Those who could not afford the migration were devoid of it. The Internet has also raised the level of aspiration of the students. Now they are not satisfied with what they are getting, they are demanding more. This is also creating pressure on educational institutions to provide the best quality education to them. Investors are bullish No revolution has ever been successful without the support of money. The education revolution is no different. With cut throat competition and almost saturation in the."
