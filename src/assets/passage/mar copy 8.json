    "passage":"Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. We look ahead in our uniquely American way restless, bold, and optimistic and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took - an oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On We the People who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great nation and we are a good people. Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. There is much to repair, restore and heal. Few periods in our nation history have been more challenging or difficult than the one were in now. A deadly virus silently stalked the country. It has taken as many lives, in one year as America lost in all of Second World War. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of business closed. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that cannot be any more desperate or any clearer. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. On implementing them on a real-world level rather than just talking about them. Offline vs Online Marketing As a result of the online shopping trend post-Covid, the beauty industry has been able to survive despite the grave impact it has had on the offline market. Even though the challenges of selling beauty products offline still exist for many, especially those who are not able to get their hands on them online or may not possess much knowledge of digital technology, it still remains a challenge for many. It has also led to the emergence of price differences, discounts and rates that are offered by different beauty brands under marketing and promotional initiatives. Furthermore, there are also many unofficial beauty."
